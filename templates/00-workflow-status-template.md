## Implementation Support Progress

Use this section when moving from planning artifacts into implementation work. These support skills are optional and can be used whenever enough planning context exists. Keep the status current so build, review, verification, and retrospective work can resume safely across sessions.

| Support Artifact | Skill | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `help-note.md` | `des-help` | Not Started | Optional workflow explanation or routing note |
| `change-brief.md` | `des-brainstorm-change` | Not Started | Scope change, new feature, or incident follow-up |
| `epics.md` | `des-create-epic` | Not Started | Epics derived from approved DES artifacts |
| `sprint-status.yaml` | `des-sprint-planning` | Not Started | Sprint/story/review/verify/retro status tracking |
| `<story-key>.md` | `des-create-story` | Not Started | Context-rich story packet from artifacts and repo context |
| `readiness-report.md` | `des-check-implementation-readiness` | Not Started | Readiness gate before dev-story |
| `implementation-plan.md` | `des-implementation-planning` | Not Started | Tasks mapped to planning artifacts |
| `implementation-story.md` | `des-implementation-planning` | Not Started | Executable dev packet with ACs, tasks, guardrails, file list, change log |
| `implementation-log.md` | `des-dev-story` | Not Started | Files changed, tests run, deviations |
| `review-report.md` | `des-code-review` | Not Started | Findings against artifacts/contracts/DQ/security |
| `verification-report.md` | `des-verify-delivery` | Not Started | Fresh command evidence |
| `implementation-retrospective.md` | `des-retrospective` | Not Started | Lessons, artifact drift, follow-up backlog |

**Status values**: `Not Started` → `In Progress` → `Done` → `Blocked (reason)` → `Skipped (reason)`

## Implementation Readiness / Definition of Done

| Gate | Checklist | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Implementation Readiness | `checklists/implementation-readiness-checklist.md` | Not Started | Must pass before `des-dev-story` unless risk is explicitly accepted |

## Next Session Prompt

Copy and paste this at the start of the next agent session:

```text
Continue this DES-SKILL project.

Read these files in order:
1. .agents/des-skill/DES-WORKFLOW.md
2. .agents/des-skill/sprint-status/des-workflow-status.md
3. .agents/des-skill/output/ (scan all completed artifacts)

Then:
- Identify the current phase from des-workflow-status.md
- Check that all upstream phase artifacts are complete before starting the next phase
- Activate the correct next skill from the Skill column
- Write the next artifact to .agents/des-skill/output/
- Update des-workflow-status.md: set artifact status to Done, update Current Phase and Next Recommended Skill
```
